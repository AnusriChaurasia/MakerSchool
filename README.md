# MakerSchool

As of today everyone is aware of the concept of MakerSpace very well. It is a place where people introduce and implement their innovative and optimistic ideas. It lets the people 
to either propose changes to existing outdated systems or create an entirely new product for an existing problem or better lifestyle with the association of their creativity, idea
and sometimes technology. It is widespread in all the domains starting from schools to working professionals but still limited as this concept demands a dedicated space which is 
not everytime easy to manage. Also many good and prudent ideas are not able to reach this space due to lack of resources, time and reach. 
MakerSchool is an android application which will closely address those problems and get this space accessible to all. Also MakerSchool provides a collaboration platform to those 
who are great when it comes to proposing ideas and to those who get the ideas to work in real life. This app will be available to all, regardless of the place, occupation and age.
The app will also be soundful to those who want to learn as they can volunteer as helpers for certain projects after accepted by the team lead and they will be providing them with 
the tasks outstretching their potential to a level ahead. MakerSchool will be a great way to learn, grow and develop without following the conventional norms.
